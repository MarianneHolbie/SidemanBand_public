# SidemanBand Web App

Welcome to the SidemanBand web app repository! 
The world is populated by both professional and nonprofessional music groups. The individuals comprising these groups often participate in multiple bands or pursue music as a secondary occupation. Just like anyone else, they may encounter unforeseen circumstances such as illness, injury, or work-related travel that necessitates their absence.
When a music group plans a concert, the designated person in charge typically begins by inquiring about everyone's availability. If necessary, they then proceed to search for potential replacements. The primary objective is to find substitute musicians as quickly as possible to allow for rehearsals with the new members, if applicable. Nevertheless, there are instances where replacements need to be secured at the eleventh hour.
Finding suitable replacements can be a complex process that often relies on musician networks. These networks facilitate the exchange of potential names and contact information through phone calls. However, sharing someone's contact details without their consent poses difficulties, and acting as the intermediary can result in a waste of time.
This project aims to streamline the process of finding replacements for music groups, eliminating the need for extensive phone calls that consume hours of valuable time.

SidemanBand is the perfect platform to help Band to found sidemen and for Sideman to found band to replace for gig.
